# CNN From Scratch

I am writing a Convolutional Neural Network Programme using only core Python packages. The idea behind this is that if I can build the model step by step, I will grow to understand how it works from the ground up. CNNs, being the most complicated ML algorithms should mean that once I have completed this I can understand all the other algorithms as well.

This diagram below shows a high level view of the structure of a Convolutional Neural Network.

## TODO List

 - [ ] Write functions for forwards pass of the model.
	- [x] func: convolution
	- [x] func: pooling
	- [x] Fully Connected Neural Network section - TEST
	- [ ] Implement layer classes to enable computation graph method
 - [ ] Write processes for backpropagation
 - [ ] Test functions and debug
 - [ ] Aim for > 90% accuracy on MNIST
